4. File "intermediate.txt" contains Intermediate code
5. File "optab.txt" contains Opcode table

This code converts input program into intermediate code, which is the output of PASS 1 Assembler.
And then this intermediate code is then converted into the object program, which is the output of Pass 2 Assembler.
