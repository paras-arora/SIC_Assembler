Topic : IMPLEMENT TWO-PASS ASSEMBLER FOR SIC ARCHITECTURE


Help:
1.Code present in file "SIC2pass.C"
2. Compile using GCC GNU Compiler (CODE BLOCKS)
3. File "object_prog.txt" contains Object Program
4. File "intermediate.txt" contains Intermediate code
5. File "optab.txt" contains Opcode table
6. File "program.txt" contains the Sample Program

Overview--
This code converts input program into intermediate code, which is the output of PASS 1 Assembler.
And then this intermediate code is then converted into the object program, which is the output of Pass 2 Assembler.


Thankyou.
